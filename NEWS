----------

- Add mono channel support as requested by users.
- Refactor several files.
- Drop frequency measurement in oscilloscope - spectrum does it now
  and can be run in parallel. Gives better resolution and magnitude.

----------

- Update README with binaries installation and Visual Studio instructions
- Fix frequency response export in Windows
- Add Visual Studio and MSVC support

- Increase font size in legend

2022-04-20
----------

- Display base frequency, magnitude and THD in spectrum.
- Add Blackman-Harris window function.
- Increase resolution (> 16 bit) using floating point audio data.
- Catch more errors to avoid crash.
- Compile in DirectSound and WASAPI on Windows.
- Use timer loop instead of sleep for frequency response.

2021-11-04
----------

- Reformat README.md and fix instructions.
- Update to latest RtAudio.

  for input and output

2008-08-26
----------

2008-08-25
----------

- first Linux port!!! - compilable with wxGTK-2.6.4 wth GTK2 and
- UNICODE; a plenty of problems:
  - GEN gauges do not work as expected
  - glitches in generator
  - wxTextCtrls do not react to ENTERs
- SA - variable FFT length
- SA - right channel is added
- SA - averaging of FFT values introduced

2008-08-22
----------

- renamed OScopeCtrl->CtrlOScope; double buffering and some other features
  added
- #define for switch XScale to microseconds/div - but a lot of problems with
  strange modulation

2008-08-21
----------

- first working version of AudMeS with RtAudio driver - MinGW compiler
